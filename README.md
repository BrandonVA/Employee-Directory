## Description

This is a react application that generates a list of random employees and lets you sort through them or filter the employees. The main purpose of this project is to learn how react works and learn how to manage state in react. This application generates 50 random employees and lets you sort them by name phone number or email along with letting you filter all the employees by the same fields and updates the page with only the current matching employees without having to refresh or load the page again.
